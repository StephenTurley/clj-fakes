# clj-fakes
clj-fakes is an isolation framework for Clojure/ClojureScript. It makes creating mocks and stubs for unit testing much easier.

One of the unique features is the ability to find unused fakes in order to help you write more concise test cases.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/clj-fakes/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/clj-fakes)

## Features
* All test doubles are named "fakes" to simplify terminology
* Fakes can be created for:
  * protocol and Java interface instances
  * functions
* "Nice" and "strict" protocol fakes are supported
* Monkey patching is supported to fake implicit dependencies
* Self-testing: automatically checks for unused fakes
* Test runner agnostic
* Arrange-Act-Assert style testing

## Status
Core functionality is ready but API is not stable yet. More features are on the way.

## Requirements

Clojure 1.7.0 and/or ClojureScript 1.7.28 or higher.

## Installation
Add this to your dependencies in project.clj:

```clj
[clj-fakes "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Examples

### Fake protocol instance with recorded method (aka mock object)

```clj
(defprotocol AnimalProtocol
  (speak [this name]))
; ...

(deftest example
  (f/with-fakes
    ; create fake instance of specified protocol
    (let [cow (f/reify-fake p/AnimalProtocol
                            ; ask framework to record method calls
                            (speak :recorded-fake))]
      ; call method on fake object
      (p/speak cow "Bob")
      
      ; assert that method was called with specified args
      (is (f/method-was-called p/speak cow ["Bob"])))))
```

### Patch a function

```clj
(deftest example
  (f/with-fakes
    (f/patch! #'funcs/sum (f/fake [[1 2] "foo"
                                   [3 4] "bar"]))
    (is (= "foo" (funcs/sum 1 2)))
    (is (= "bar" (funcs/sum 3 4))))
  
  ; patching is reverted on exiting with-fakes block
  (is (= 3 (funcs/sum 1 2))))
```

### Self-tests

```clj
(f/with-fakes
  (f/fake [f/any? nil]))
; will raise "Self-test: no call detected for: non-optional fake ..."
```

```clj
(f/with-fakes
  (f/recorded-fake))
; will raise "Self-test: no check performed on: recorded fake ..."
```
